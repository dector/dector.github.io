<p>Hell is other people.
<em>/J. P. Sartre/</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some time ago I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time thinking about principles upon which I&rsquo;d like to build high-quality relations with another people. For a long time, they were just some implicit stimuli inside my brain. I&rsquo;ve always walked around but never proclaimed them loud and clear even to myself.</p>

<p>But one night when I drifted in the ocean of thoughts instead of sleeping as all adequate people do, I catch myself on that feeling that I have something to write down. I did it. In few (?) days I improved that text, translated it and committed to github. There were three important principles about building mature inter-person relationships (not only romantic one) as I see it. About a month ago I&rsquo;ve added the fourth principle.</p>

<p>You can find the latest version of <a href="https://github.com/dector/social-interaction/blob/master/Interpersonal-Relationship-Principles.md">&ldquo;Interpersonal Relationship Principles&rdquo; on github</a>.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m gonna make a quick mention about each principle here.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Personal Freedom</strong>. This is really important and valuable for me. I consider any dependency from another person as utterly undesirable.</p>

<p><strong>Honesty</strong>. No manipulation and no information concealment.</p>

<p><strong>Cooperation</strong>. I think that with cooperation relationship can be more productive in achieving shared goals. Besides that, struggling against uncooperative behavior is really pooping.</p>

<p><strong>Discussions</strong>. Very ancient and maybe one of the most efficient instrument for sharing expectations and resolving conflicts of interests. Still, works in the 21st century.</p>

<p>I believe that more principles are involved - better for relationships. Obviously, I can be wrong or incomplete on this list. If you had something to say - <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/Dvj8VyoQp5XyDJD93">contact me</a> via the anonymous form.</p>
