<p>See <a href="/post/trust/">previous post</a> for better understanding what&rsquo;s going on here.</p>

<p>Yesterday this thought popped out in my head. Usually, people talk about &ldquo;trust&rdquo; when they are talking about relationships (mostly about romantic one).</p>

<p>But I didn&rsquo;t mention &ldquo;trust&rdquo; in my principles. So I asked myself &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;, thought a little and switched to another activity. The answer has arrived when I was riding on the empty road today.</p>

<p>Some time ago I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time thinking about principles upon which I&rsquo;d like to build high-quality relations with another people. For a long time, they were just some implicit stimuli inside my brain. I&rsquo;ve always walked around but never proclaimed them loud and clear even to myself.</p>

<p>But one night when I drifted in the ocean of thoughts instead of sleeping as all adequate people do, I catch myself on that feeling that I have something to write down. I did it. In few (?) days I improved that text, translated it and committed to github. There were three important principles about building mature inter-person relationships (not only romantic one) as I see it. About a month ago I&rsquo;ve added the fourth principle.</p>

<p>You can find the latest version of <a href="https://github.com/dector/social-interaction/blob/master/Interpersonal-Relationship-Principles.md">&ldquo;Interpersonal Relationship Principles&rdquo; on github</a>.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m gonna make a quick mention about each principle here.</p>
