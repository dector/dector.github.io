      <title>Trust in Relationships?</title>

&lt;p&gt;Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none.
&lt;em&gt;/William Shakespeare/&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;https://dector.github.io/post/trust/&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; for better understanding what&amp;rsquo;s going on here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday this thought popped out in my head. Usually, people talk about &amp;ldquo;trust&amp;rdquo; when they are talking about relationships (mostly about romantic one).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I didn&amp;rsquo;t mention &amp;ldquo;trust&amp;rdquo; in my principles. So I asked myself &amp;ldquo;Why?&amp;rdquo;, thought a little and switched to another activity. The answer has arrived when I was riding on the empty road today.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Important Relationship Principles</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hell is other people.
&lt;em&gt;/J. P. Sartre/&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some time ago I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a lot of time thinking about principles upon which I&amp;rsquo;d like to build high-quality relations with another people. For a long time, they were just some implicit stimuli inside my brain. I&amp;rsquo;ve always walked around but never proclaimed them loud and clear even to myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one night when I drifted in the ocean of thoughts instead of sleeping as all adequate people do, I catch myself on that feeling that I have something to write down. I did it. In few (?) days I improved that text, translated it and committed to github. There were three important principles about building mature inter-person relationships (not only romantic one) as I see it. About a month ago I&amp;rsquo;ve added the fourth principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the latest version of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dector/social-interaction/blob/master/Interpersonal-Relationship-Principles.md&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Interpersonal Relationship Principles&amp;rdquo; on github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;rsquo;m gonna make a quick mention about each principle here.&lt;/p&gt;
