<p>Hell is other people.
<em>/J. P. Sartre/</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some time ago I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time thinking about principles upon which I&rsquo;d like to build high-quality relations with another people. For a long time, they were just some implicit stimuli inside my brain. I&rsquo;ve always walked around but never proclaimed them loud and clear even to myself.</p>

<p>But one night when I drifted in the ocean of thoughts instead of sleeping as all adequate people do, I catch myself on that feeling that I have something to write down. I did it. In few (?) days I improved that text, translated it and committed to github. There were three important principles about building mature inter-person relationships (not only romantic one) as I see it. About a month ago I&rsquo;ve added the fourth principle.</p>

<p>You can find the latest version of <a href="https://github.com/dector/social-interaction/blob/master/Interpersonal-Relationship-Principles.md">&ldquo;Interpersonal Relationship Principles&rdquo; on github</a>.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m gonna make a quick mention about each principle here.</p>
